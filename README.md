# Materials science Yolo
yolo v8 (you look only once) object detection network applied for atom tracking in Materials science

This library is essentially a wrapper that allows to track atoms in electron microscopy images. Here you can find weights that are sutable for fining small round blobs in an image. 

A full description of yolo is avalible at ultralytics website, please concider reading https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/.
